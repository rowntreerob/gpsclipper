=head1 GPSClipper for Android

In one step, update with GEOTAGS each photo in an on-line web album using latitude/longitude data from a file stored on the phone. 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For those using cameras without built-in GPS, integrated GPS can be approximated by using android phone's apps such as 
B<MyTracks> to record data while the photos are being taken. Once the photos have been uploaded to either Picasa or to G+, run the app on the phone, selecting the album and the GPS data and all the on-line photos will have GPS data applied to them.
