         You need to have an app such as these used for displaying list of files and for choosing files from the list. 
         You will need to be able to find the folder on the phone's sdcard or external storage area where 
         Geotag files containing Latitude/ Longitude are kept.

        <td>
         When you are taking photos with your camera, you need to have running on the phone an app such as these used for
         recording a set of  latitude readings. This app creates the GeoRss tags data that will be used to update the photos. 
         Output type <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_eXchange_Format">GPX</a> is required by GPSClipper. 
        </td></tr>
<tr class="b"><td>GPX File from the GPS app will be used to update Photos</td>
        <td>
         If you are walking 
         around taking pictures for 30 minutes then the MyTracks latitude recorder app should be running during those same 30 minutes. 
         When you are done taking the pictures, you can stop the GPS recorder app and save the recorded track as type
         <a href="images/device-mytrks_save_dialog_2.png">GPX</a>.
         The  <a href="images/device-mytrks_save_dialog_1.png">SaveAs </a> dialog for storing GPX data should put the file in a folder on the phone where you 
         can find it later during the update photos step.  
        </td></tr>
<tr class="a"><td>GMail Account</td>
        <td>
        Logons, identity, and Access Authorization are all controlled in collaboration with Google Accounts. GPSClipper requires no
        signups, no logons and no personal data. Where you need access to something like a photo album, you will first logon your phone to 
        your GMail account. 
        </td></tr>        
<tr class="b"><td>Camera Photos Uploaded to Web</td>
        <td>
            Your web facility for your photo albums needs to be either Picasa or the Photo Tab under Google+. Use the Picasa uploader, or the <strong>
            Upload new photos</strong> button in Google+. Create a new album with a name that you can remember for following step where 
            you select a photo album for update. Note that GPSClipper is currently limited to web based photo albums that are
            under the control and access authority of your GMail Account. 
        </td></tr>
<tr class="a"><td>GPSClipper Install </td>
        <td>
        Not all levels of android support the app or have been tested. If you have Gingerbread or a newer version of Android on your
        phone then, you should be able to find the app in the store and to download/install to your device.         
        </td></tr> 
<tr class="b"><td>Clock Synchronization</td>
        <td>
            The update strategy where Latitude/Longitude from a GPX data file, created on the phone in conjunction with the phone's clock
            setting is used to update photos depends on two clocks being synchronized. So, check your phone clock. Check the setting for 
            Daylight Savings. Then go to the camera system settings and check the clock there. Phone time should equal camera time. 
            If the phone says 9:23 AM tuesday the 14th of May, then the camera should say the exact same thing. If there is a discrepancy
            then resolve it before attempting updates using GPSClipper. 
            Both the phone and the camera should have the same configuration for Daylight Savings.

            Startup the app.  You may be prompted for one or two things by Google. Wifi connection is strongly recommended due to 
            the volume of Network traffic involved in processing the updates when you OK the last step. If there are more than 10 photos in your album and 
            you attempt an update over 3G connection, you may have to wait for awhile. See

    have one of these apps. Choose the app you will use to select the GPX file. I use OI File Manager.</td>

    that if you took your first album photo <strong> after</strong> launching the GPS recorder, then the youngest timestamp value in the 
    GPX file will be from a moment in time <strong>preceeding</strong> the timestamp value on the first photo taken in the album. This will
    give best results during the update. Likewise, the GPS recording should have been stopped after the last photo was taken. This will assure
    that there exist Latitude/Longitude readings in the GPX file having timestamps <strong>after</strong> the timestamp for the last photo
    in the album.   </td>

    from the GPX file you selected in order to update the Photo Album that you selected. Best matching technique currently selects the 
    Latitude/Longitude pair from the data in the selected GPX file having a timestamp value closest to the that of the photo being updated. 
    Press the OK button to begin the update. A dialog will Alert you that an update is taking place. On a good wifi connection the photos
            in the selected album each take less than a second to update. Be patient will the phone calls the google API for each of the 
            photo update operations. At the end the update review display will display how many photos were updated. </td>
